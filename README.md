# Tensorflow test projects
A bunch of test programs I have used to understand TensorFlow, Numpy, and Pandas to create my own machine learning models
Each test project has comments elaborating on the use of each function used in the program.

# WARNING
Some of the models I have used are deprecated and will not be supported by tensorflow for much longer. I have started working on updating my first few testproject to the new and improved keras library. Please do not try to replicate those mentioned models. If you experience any errors during runtime of the model, create an Issue so that I can try to fix it. 

Have fun learning!
